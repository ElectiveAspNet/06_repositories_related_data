# Students

Create a new project in VS2017.    

The main idea is to get used to creating and working with VS 2017 instaed of VS Code.

The project should contain what we did so fare in the VS Code Student Project.   

Further you should include repositories and you should create the 2 extra entities and tables in the database whoch you can see underneath here.

You should also have controllers for Courses and Enrollment and you should scaffold views for these.
